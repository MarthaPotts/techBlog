Models -> db structure
Separation of Concerns ->tables/keys 

home-routes needs to connect 

user seeds, more seeds with more structure and progress 
    on the models 

Handlebars: learn it. 

npm i 
seed the db 

make posts 
complete json seed files 

1. Server works 
2. seed database 
3. routes/models 



Second verse, same as the first...

CMS-style blog site 

homepage -> sign in or sign up 

nav for home and dashboard 
    -> existing posts on homepage 
    -> all links prompt signup/sign in unless logged in 

    -> signUp: username and password, auto sign out with idle 

blog posts must include 
    -> post title, date created in header 
    -> click on header -> title, contents, post creator's username, date created 

dashboard in nav -> any blog posts already created (myPosts) and option to addNew 
    ->button ->onclick, prompt: enter Title and Contents submit -> save and return to updated dashboard
    ->existing posts update/delete then return to dashboard 

Logout in nav 

Tech: must include:

MVC folder structure and pardigm 

Express-handlebars 

mySQL2 

Sequelize 

mySQL db 

Express.js API for controllers 

dotenv package, bcrypt package, express-session, connect-session-sequelize 

Must be deployed to Heroku /url 

Github URL 

"application resembles the mock-up functionality provided" 

Model/View/Controller: 

models -> db (mySQL, sequelize, mySQL2)

view-> user interface and frontend logic  (express-handlebars)

controller -> routes and backend logic (express.js)

User side: 
Nav bar needs completed: 
Home/Dashboard/Login/Logout ? add Signup? or *render if no account found? 

Hey Dummy! you didn't add a Username to the form! How are they supposed to post with their username if you don't give them the chance? 
And what does your dashboard look like? 
Why isn't it clearly found as 'dashboard'? 

so...
what you have here is...

HOME = Inactive without LoginAuth.? Can only 'view title'. 

'Login' = page(s) active = 
    : links work, view all of post.body, add comments
    : dashboard access 
        : dashboard = add post/edit post 
if login not auth redirect* to signup. 
signup = create newUser -> login simultaneously? at signup? 

make functions for the buttons, Dummy. 
add a UserName field, Dummy: it's used as a post Identifier.:  
post-creator's username....
